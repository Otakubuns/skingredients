**Skingredients** is a website created to provide reliable skincare information on drugstore products. 
This was my capstone project and was designed to be useful and engaging, combining my interest in skincare with the practical application of my skills from my program.

## Features

### Products Page

The **Products Page** is your go-to resource for exploring all the products in our database. Here’s what you can do:

- **Filter Products** by category and brand.
- **Search** for specific products by name, brand.

### Routine Creator

The **Routine Creator** helps you build personalized skincare routines. Here’s what it offers:

- **Add Products** to your routine and see the recommended order of use (not perfect just yet).
- **View Main Ingredients** of each product(actives, hydrating products, etc.).
- **Identify Common Mistakes** in routine creation(reminder if there's no sunscreen in routine, cleanser).
- **Check Ingredient Compatibility** to ensure your chosen products work well together.
- **Include Custom Products** and get ingredient information and compatibility checks if ingredient details are provided.
- **Cost of Routine** to understand how expensive your routine could be.

The routine creator can also be run without the server if only inputting custom products.

## Future Improvements

The Routine Creator is not perfect and some bugs need fixing. Future improvements will include:

- Improved product orders for every category of product
- Improved compatibility checks for custom products.
- Check for even more types of ingredient incompatibility
- Addition of more Canadian websites(Sephora)
- Additional features to make routine creation even more user-friendly.

## Deployment Status

Currently, Skingredients is not deployed. There are plans to deploy the website once the Routine Creator is fully finished and all major bugs are fixed. Stay tuned for updates!
