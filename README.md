# Skingredients
Skingredients is a website created with the purpose of giving good skincare information on drugstore products.

This was my capstone project and I wanted it to be something that not only eas useful but also something I had an interest in.



Products Page:

The products page is where you can find all the products that are in the database. You can filter the products by category and by brand. You can also search for a specific product by name.

Routine Creator:
The routine creator is where you can create a skincare routine. You can add products to your routine and see the order in which you should use them(with some error). You can also see the main ingredients of the products.
Currently the routine creator shows common mistakes that people make when creating a skincare routine. It will also check for ingredients that are not compatible with each other.
The creator is not perfect and there are some bugs that I would like to fix in the future.
This also allows custom products within the routine and will show ingredient info and compatibility if ingredients are given.
